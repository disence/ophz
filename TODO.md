* Add nice colormap to the .tif files

* OPHZ-B: identical to OPHZ-A, except that international borders and coastlines have been filled with the nearest data values. This is particularly useful for regions such as the lovely crinkly edges of Maine.

* OPHZ-C: fill larger gaps of open water (-99), especially where there may be small islands that were not visible in PHZM-US48.

* WGS84 version?
