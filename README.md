Open Plant Hardiness Zones (OPHZ)
===

OPHZ is free and open raster data derived from the public domain map images available at:
    http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/

The data will be made available in different flavors, each representing a different level of processing.

* **PHZM-US48** is the original PDF (in an Albers Conical Equal Area projection), downloaded from
    http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Images/All_states_halfzones_poster_rgb_300dpi.pdf

* **OPHZ-A** is a raster of data values, where each colored pixel of PHZM-US48 has been translated to a value representing lower end of each zone's temperature range.  Labels, state boundaries, and the elevation hillshade have been removed, although international borders, coastlines, and a few major rivers appear as -98.  Open water is -99.  This raster is currently limited to the 48 contiguous US states (US48).
